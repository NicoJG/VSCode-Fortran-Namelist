# Fortran Namelist Syntax Highlighting

VS Code extension for syntax highlighting and folding in Fortran Namelist (`.nml`, `.namelist`) files.

My personal use case: Parameter files for the [GENE Code](https://genecode.org/)

## Features

- Syntax highlighting for variables, numbers, strings, booleans, and comments
- Folding for namelist blocks (`&name ... /`)
- Supports `.nml` and `.namelist` file extensions

## Usage

Just install and open your Fortran Namelist filesâ€”no configuration needed.
